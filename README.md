# blockchain
So yeah, i've been busy the last couple of days coding this simple blockchain prototype, i'd say it is the first one i created, i'll make improvements in it in the future
but by now it is "complete" in a simple way. 
It has a PoW system with rewards to miners, block mining difficulty  and everything else that a conventional blockchain has.
